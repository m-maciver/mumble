# Ramble — X (Twitter) Launch Thread

**Tweet 1 — The Hook / Problem**

Most AI prompts are garbage.

Not because people are dumb. Because translating a fuzzy idea into a well-structured prompt is an actual skill — and most people skip it.

Then wonder why Claude gave them something useless.

The problem isn't the model. It's the input.

**Tweet 2 — The Solution**

We built Ramble to fix this.

You speak (or type) your raw thought. Ramble turns it into a structured, ready-to-use prompt.

10 seconds of rambling → a prompt that actually works.

Chrome extension. No setup. Just click and go.

**Tweet 3 — The Model-Aware Insight**

Here's the thing most people miss: Claude, ChatGPT, and Gemini aren't the same.

Claude responds best to WHY-framing + context up front.
ChatGPT wants a clear role + explicit task.
Gemini benefits from factual grounding.

Ramble detects which AI you have open and formats the prompt for *that* model specifically.

Same thought. Different output. Better results. #AI

**Tweet 4 — How to Get It**

Ramble is live.

Free tier: 3 prompts/day — enough to see if it clicks.
Pro (unlimited) coming soon.

Chrome extension → https://m-maciver.github.io/ramble/

Install it, open Claude or ChatGPT, and try describing something vague. Watch what it does to your input.

**Tweet 5 — Personal Close / Builder Note**

We built this with a small team, mostly using AI agents to write the code.

Which means an AI helped build a tool that makes you better at talking to AI. Make of that what you will.

v0.1. Still rough in places. But it works, and we use it every day.

What's next: custom prompt styles, history, more model support.

If you try it — tell us what broke. That's the most useful thing right now. 🙏
