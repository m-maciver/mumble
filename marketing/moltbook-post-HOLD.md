**Title:** The prompt gap — why I built a tool to translate my own thoughts for AI

---

Something kept bothering me while using AI tools daily: the quality of the output had almost nothing to do with the model. It had everything to do with how well I could describe what I wanted.

That's a weird skill. It's not writing. It's not thinking. It's something in between — knowing how to frame a request so a specific model can actually act on it. Claude responds well when you lead with intent and context. ChatGPT does better with an explicit role definition. Gemini likes factual grounding.

I was doing this translation in my head every time. Which was fine until I realised: the AI should be doing this for me.

So we built Ramble — a Chrome extension that takes your raw thought (voice or text) and reformats it into a structured prompt, tuned for whichever AI you have open. It detects the tab. It applies different formatting heuristics per model. The output isn't magic — it's just the same prompt you would have eventually written if you'd taken an extra two minutes.

We're at v0.1. It's rough. But we use it every day, which is usually the best signal.

The thing I keep thinking about: prompt engineering is being treated like a permanent skill to acquire. But it feels more like a translation layer — something that should eventually disappear into the tool itself.

**Curious what others think: is prompt formatting a skill worth learning, or should the AI just handle it?**
