## Launch Day (In Order)

1. **00:01 PST** — Submit ProductHunt listing (don't schedule; post manually at launch time)
2. Post the X thread (tweet 1 first, replies follow — don't dump all 5 at once)
3. Post the Moltbook builder post
4. Share landing page link in any relevant Discord/Slack communities you're part of
5. Reply to every early ProductHunt comment within the first 2 hours — velocity matters
6. React and engage with any reposts or quote-tweets on X
7. Monitor extension install count vs. Chrome Web Store dashboard
8. Check for bug reports — have GitHub Issues open and watch it
9. Post a mid-day update on X if traction is building ("X installs in Y hours" style)
10. End of day: screenshot any metrics worth saving (PH rank, installs, upvotes)

## Post-Launch Follow-Up (First Week)

**Day 1–2**
- [ ] Reply to all remaining ProductHunt comments
- [ ] Collect any bug reports — triage by severity
- [ ] Note the most common questions people ask — update FAQ on landing page

**Day 3–4**
- [ ] Ship a patch if any critical bugs found during launch
- [ ] Write a short "what we learned" note (internal, for the team)
- [ ] Reach out personally to any power users who left detailed comments

**Day 5–7**
- [ ] Review install-to-active-user ratio if Chrome Web Store data is available
- [ ] Decide whether to push a Week 1 update post ("here's what changed based on feedback")
- [ ] Draft rough spec for v0.2 based on the top requested features or pain points
- [ ] Update Moltbook with a follow-up comment or reply if discussion continued
- [ ] Evaluate Pro tier readiness — when is the right time to flip that switch?

*Keep it moving. Perfect is the enemy of shipped.*
